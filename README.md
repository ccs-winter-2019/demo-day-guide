# A Guide to Presenting on Demo Day

## Format

Students present their projects "science fair" style. This means that you won't be doing one long presentation to a huge group of people. Instead, you will have a series of shorter conversations with small groups (3-5 people). 

This format lends itself really well to the diverse group of attendees that will be at demo day, plus it puts less pressure on you. You have multiple, different opportunities to make a good impression, and if you mess one of them up, it's not a big deal. 

It also allows you to cater what you talk about to each audience. If one group is more technical, talk about the crazy JavaScript, Python or Ruby that you wrote. If another group is HR personnel, talk about your process, user stories, etc. If a third group is friends and family, focus on the details of your actual product or talk about your experience attending Carolina Code School.

That said, you should have a pre-rehearsed introduction to get the conversation going. The goal of this introduction is to give your audience a little bit of background and start engaging in a conversation.

Your pre-rehearsed "presentation" should be no more than...

**3 minutes long!**

Your goal is to get as much of the following information in those 3 minutes. You might not be able to do it all, but be as efficient as possible with your words. 3 minutes is not a long time.

## Content

Every time I start trying to put together a presentation I watch this TED talk and try to structure my presentation based on "the golden circle".

1. Introduce yourself (the "why")
  * Tell the audience your name and briefly talk about your background before Carolina Code School.
  * Talk about why you picked the project that you did. Ideally, this will be in story form (5-6 sentences) focusing on your connection to the topic and the problem that you're solving. Out of all of the possible ideas, what motivated you to pick this one? Bonus points if your story relates back to your introduction of yourself in some way.
2. Talk about your process (the "how") 
  * Talk about the process you went through to come up with your idea and how you executed it. You won't always be speaking to a technical audience, so "the how" should tease at the technical aspects while not totally overwhelming an HR person with no programming experience. If someone is interested in your tech specifically, they will ask for more details. Give those tech people something to ask about if they're curious, but don't spend too much time on it.
  * Talk about all of the other aspects of how your final project came to fruition. Weave in any relevant experiences that you had throughout the course that informed how you approached the project. Did you learn anything from the group project or from an individual assignment that you used in your final project?
  * Feel free to talk about user stories, wire frames, data modeling, etc. These are all parts of your process.
3. Talk about your project (the "what")
  * Pulling the first two points together, tell your audience what your final product is. This should be a one sentence description of what your app does. The goal here is to give them context, but it's much better to show "what" you made rather than try to explain it.
  * Demo your product. Try to maintain eye contact with the audience and don't hunch over the keyboard. Make sure you are pre-logged in to your application. Nobody cares that you can log in, that is assumed.
  * The best demos are in story form. "Imagine Sally is going to the grocery store for the first time after discovering she has a food allergy..." and proceed to walk them through the features of your app. As the character in your story encounters a problem, show how the app can help to solve it.
4. End on a strong note
  * Don't end with something like "that's it." Saying that de-values all the hard work you did. A good way to close the "presentation" part of your conversation is by asking "may I answer any questions?".

## Presentation Tips

1. Smile! Your app can be crashing and burning behind you with all the bugs in the world, but if you are smiling your audience won't know the difference, and everything will work out fine.
2. Choose your words wisely. Since you have such a short period of time, you don't want to waste time on long, irrelevant tangents.
3. Practice slowing down your tempo. This might seem counter intuitive, but you want to speak at the same rate as the brain of your slowest audience member can process. Also, if you speak faster than your brain can process, you'll end up wasting a lot of time saying "umm..." and "like...".
4. Go with the flow. If an audience member asks a question in the middle of your presentation, take the conversation where they want it to go. The best thing that can happen is your audience asks a lot of questions. This means that they are engaged and are interested in what you're saying. Don't kill this vibe, roll with it.
5. Make good eye contact and assume a confident posture. Not only will this reflect well on you, but it will also make you more confident. Don't hunch over. Take up space with your body. Use lots of gestures.
6. Don't speak in a monotone voice. Show that you are excited about all the work that you did!
7. Keep your talk positive! Stories about overcoming problems are great, but only if you focus on the solution and your problem solving skills rather than the problem itself.
